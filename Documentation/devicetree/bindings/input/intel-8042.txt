Intel 8042 Keyboard Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "intel,8042"
- regs: memory for keyboard controller
- interrupts: usually, two interrupts should be specified (keyboard and aux).
	However, only one interrupt is also allowed in case of absence of the
	physical port in the controller. The i8042 driver must be loaded with
	nokbd/noaux option in this case.
- interrupt-names: interrupt names corresponding to numbers in the list.
	"kbd" is the keyboard interrupt and "aux" is the auxiliary (mouse)
	interrupt.
- command-reg: offset in memory for command register
- status-reg: offset in memory for status register
- data-reg: offset in memory for data register

Example:
	i8042@d8008800 {
		compatible = "intel,8042";
		regs = <0xd8008800 0x100>;
		interrupts = <23>, <4>;
		interrupt-names = "kbd", "aux";
		command-reg = <0x04>;
		status-reg = <0x04>;
		data-reg = <0x00>;
	};
