* Intel 8042 interface

This is an attempt to make a compatible binding with existing implementation
from SPARC and PowerPC, regulated by the Open Firmware standard. Since new
devices like ARM SoCs are using the newer Flattened Device Tree, this binding
should be also compatible with ePAPR, by introducing the 'compatible' property.

Required properties:
- #address-cells: Must be <1>, since the address for input devices is virtual.

- #size-cells: Must be <0>, since the size is not applicable for the virtual
  address.

- compatible: Should be "intel,8042".

- reg: Specifies the base address and size of the interface registers in the
  following order:
  - DATA: The serial data buffer address.
  - COMMAND/STATUS: Has the status of the keyboard controller and interface,
    allows to send commands to the controller.

Optional properties:
- interrupts: One (keyboard) or two (keyboard and auxiliary) interrupts.

- interrupt-names: names of interrupts, must be "kbd", "aux". If not specified,
  the first interrupt is "kbd", and the second is "aux".

Child nodes:
The i8042 interface may control input devices such as keyboard and mouse. Each
input device is represented by a child node. The input device could be
identified by the 'compatible' property or the node name (obsolete).

Required properties:
- reg: Specifies the device virtual address. These numbers should not be
  duplicated.
- compatible: should be "pnpPNP,303" for keyboard, and "pnpPNP,f03" for mouse.

Optional properties:
- interrupts: Specifies the interrupt number for the device. Overwrites the
  value from the parent node.

Examples:

// Most preferred way
ps2@d8008800 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "intel,8042";
	reg = <0xd8008800 0x1>, <0xd8008804 0x1>;
	interrupts = <23>, <4>;
	interrupt-names = "kbd", "aux";

	keyboard@0 {
		reg = <0x0>;
		compatible = "pnpPNP,303";
	};

	mouse@1 {
		reg = <0x1>;
		compatible = "pnpPNP,f03";
	};
};

// PowerPC
i8042@60 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	reg = <0x1 0x60 0x1 0x1 0x64 0x1>;
	interrupts = <1 3 12 3>;
	interrupt-parent = <&i8259>;
	// 'compatible' property has to be added by the platform code

	keyboard@0 {
		reg = <0x0>;
		compatible = "pnpPNP,303";
	};

	mouse@1 {
		reg = <0x1>;
		compatible = "pnpPNP,f03";
	};
};
